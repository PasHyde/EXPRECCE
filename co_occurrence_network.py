'''
This Python module automatically generates a word co-occurrence network using a plain text file as input. 
AÂ user specifies the target words (terms under study) and the window size, i.e., how many words are considered before and after the 
target words. Then, a network is drawn using a spring layout. This algorithm simulates a force-directed representation of the network treating edges as springs 
holding nodes close while treating nodes as repelling objects.
